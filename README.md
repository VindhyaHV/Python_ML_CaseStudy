1. Write about any difficult problem that you solved. (According to us difficult - is something which 90% of people would have only 10% probability in getting a similarly good solution)

Ans : Currently I am working on a Kaggle problem called IEEE-CSI Fraud Detection. In this problem, we should Identify the Fraudulent Transactions and Users. This is the most difficult problem
I am working on right now. I have not reached top 10% yet. There are many road blocks which I need to figure out and work on.

2. Formally, a vector space V' is a subspace of a vector space V if
V' is a vector space
every element of V′ is also an element of V.
Note that ordered pairs of real numbers (a,b) a,b∈R form a vector space V. Which of the following is a subspace of V?
The set of pairs (a, a + 1) for all real a
The set of pairs (a, b) for all real a ≥ b
The set of pairs (a, 2a) for all real a
The set of pairs (a, b) for all non-negative real a,b

Ans: The set of pairs (a, b) for all non-negative real a,b
